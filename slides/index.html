                    <h2>EasyMock</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">EasyMock has been the first dynamic Mock Object generator, relieving users of hand-writing Mock Objects, or generating code for them.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">EasyMock provides Mock Objects by generating them on the fly using Java proxy mechanism.<p>

                        <p class="fragment">In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.<p>

                        <h2>Why do you need a test double?</h2>
                        <p class="fragment">Basically, to isolate the code you want to test from its surroundings</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h3>Speed up test execution</h3>
                        <p class="fragment">A test double’s implementation is often faster to execute than the real thing.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">A complex algorithm could take minutes to run, and minutes is FOREVER when we as developers want immediate feedback by running automated tests.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">You have to test those slow algorithms somewhere but not everywhere.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Make execution deterministic</h3>
                        <p class="fragment">When your code (and tests) is deterministic, you can run your tests repeatedly againts the same code and you will always get the same result.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">Obviously, this is not always the case. What happen when your code has nondeterministic behaviour: random behaviour, time-depending behaviour?</p>
                        <p class="fragment">Test doubles can lend a hand with these kinds of sources for nondeterministic behavior.</p>

                        <h3>Simulating special conditions</h3>
                        <p class="fragment">There is always some conditions we can’t create using just the APIs and features of our production code.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">This happens when our code depends on a third party API, internet connection, an specific file in some location, etc, etc.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Exposing hidden information</h3>
                        <p class="fragment">What information? information about the interactions between the code under test and its collaborators.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">Encapsulation and information hiding is a good thing in your code but complicates testing.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">You can always add methods for testing purposes to your production code. But, what if you don’t want to litter your production code with those?</p>
                        <p class="fragment">By substituting a test double for the real implementation, you can add that for-testing-only method to test code and avoid littering your production.</p>
