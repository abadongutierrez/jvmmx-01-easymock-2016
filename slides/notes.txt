## Test Doubles

They are also known as: Imposters.

### Why do you need a test double?
> To isolate the code you want to test from its surroundings

Reasons:
* Isolate the code under test
* Speed up test execution
* Make execution deterministic
* Simulate special conditions
* Gain access to hidden information

#### Speed up test execution

A test double’s implementation is often faster to execute than the real thing. Sometimes, a test double’s speed isn’t just a side effect but rather the primary reason for using a test double.

A complex algorithm could take minutes to run, and minutes is FOREVER a developer wants immediate feedback by running automated tests.

With a test double the unnecessary wait is avoided and tests run that much faster.

You have to test those slow algorithms somewhere but not everywhere.

### Make execution deterministric

When your code (and tests) is deterministic, you can run your tests repeatedly againts the same code and you will always get the same result.

Obviously, this is not always the case. What happen when your code has nondeterministic behaviour: random behaviour, time-depending behaviour.
